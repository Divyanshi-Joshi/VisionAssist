# VisionAssist
A computer vision-based application designed to assist individuals with visual impairments.

## Introduction
VisionAssist is an innovative application that utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect and identify objects in real-time, providing assistance to individuals with visual impairments. This project aims to improve the daily lives of people with visual disabilities by providing a reliable and efficient way to navigate and interact with their surroundings.

## Features
The VisionAssist application offers the following features:

* **Object Detection**: The application uses YOLOV8 object detection algorithm to identify objects in real-time providing users with accurate and reliable information about their surroundings.
* **Object Recognition**: The application can recognize and identify specific objects which allows users to search for and locate specific items.
* **Object Measurement**: The application calculates the distance and height of the detected object, providing users with a better understanding of their surroundings and enabling them to navigate safely.

## Demonstration Videos
We have created two demonstration videos to showcase the capabilities of the VisionAssist application:
